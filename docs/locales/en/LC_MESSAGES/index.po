"The `En-ROADS Climate Solutions Simulator <https://en-"
"roads.climateinteractive.org>`_ is a fast, powerful climate simulation "
"tool for understanding how we can achieve our climate goals through "
"changes in energy, land use, consumption, agriculture, and other "
"policies. The simulator focuses on how changes in global GDP, energy "
"efficiency, technological innovation, and carbon price influence carbon "
"emissions, global temperature, and other factors. It is designed to "
"provide a synthesis of the best available science on climate solutions "
"and put it at the fingertips of groups in policy workshops and "
"roleplaying games. These experiences enable people to explore the long-"
"term climate impacts of global policy and investment decisions."
