"**Increase or decrease the energy efficiency of vehicles, shipping, air "
"travel, and transportation systems.** Energy efficiency includes things "
"like hybrid cars, expanded public transport, and ways that people can get"
" around using less energy. Adopting more energy efficient practices, such"
" as cycling and walking, can improve public health and save money."
