"**Discover a brand-new cheap source of electricity that does not emit "
"greenhouse gases.** Some speculate that such a breakthrough could be "
"nuclear fusion or thorium-based nuclear fission. Decide when the "
"breakthrough occurs, its initial cost relative to coal, and how long the "
"delays in commercialization and scale up would be."

"First, notice it takes a long time for the new technology to grow and "
"become a large part of the global energy mix. There is a long delay "
"between discovery of the zero-carbon energy technology and its dominance "
"in the market – 10 years to commercialize, several years to plan and "
"build, and then growing only as existing coal and natural gas plants "
"(which have a lifetime of 30 years) are retired. Watch how little Coal "
"(brown line) and Natural Gas (dark blue line) go down before 2040. "
"Because of this, very little carbon is kept underground during a critical"
" period."

"Second, look at the “Final Energy Consumption” graph. The reason new "
"technology grows quickly is that it is cheaper than all other energy "
"supplies, so the abundance of inexpensive energy increases demand to "
"higher than it would be otherwise."
