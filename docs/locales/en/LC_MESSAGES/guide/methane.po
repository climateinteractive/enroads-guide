"**Decrease or increase greenhouse gas emissions from methane, nitrous "
"oxide, and the F-gases.** Methane is released from sources like cows, "
"agriculture, natural gas drilling, and waste. Nitrous oxide comes from "
"fertilizers. The f-gases, includes HFCs, PFCs, and others that are used "
"in industry and consumer goods like air conditioners."
