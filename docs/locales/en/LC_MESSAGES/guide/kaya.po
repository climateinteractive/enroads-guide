"**Global Population** is growing—we are currently approaching 8 billion "
"people—and anticipate growth to 11 billion by the end of the century, "
"according to UN projections. The rate of growth is slowing over time as "
"people have smaller families."

"**GDP per Capita** is growing steadily per year, and we assume it will "
"continue, mostly as people in rapidly developing countries such as China,"

"**Energy Intensity of GDP** is decreasing over time, due to the world "
"economy becoming more efficient, or using less energy per unit of "
"economic output. Technologies are improving—for example, more efficient "
"cars, buildings, and machines—and economies are shifting from "
"manufacturing to services. The product of global population, GDP per "
"capita, and the energy intensity of GDP is the total amount of energy "
"used by the global economy."

"**Carbon Intensity of Final Energy**, the amount of carbon dioxide "
"emitted by energy use, is expected to slightly decline over time. "
"Overall, this downward trend in carbon intensity is attributed to the "
"gradual shifting away from fossil fuels and towards low-carbon energy "
"sources."

"**Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Energy** is the result of all four "
"factors multiplied together, and you can see that in the Business as "
"Usual scenario emissions are growing. As the level of carbon dioxide in "
"the atmosphere correlates with temperature, an increased concentration of"
" carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leads to an increase in global "
"temperatures."

"These factors explain in simple terms, why emissions are increasing in "
"the Business as Usual scenario. Improvements in efficiency and "
"decarbonization are not yet keeping up with the strong growth in "
