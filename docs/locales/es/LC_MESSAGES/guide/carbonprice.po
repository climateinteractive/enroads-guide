"**Set a global carbon price that makes coal, oil, and gas more expensive "
"depending on how much carbon dioxide they release.** Energy producers "
"frequently pass additional costs to their customers, so policy must be "

"Pricing carbon is a high leverage strategy. It both reduces the carbon "
"intensity of the energy supply and reduces the overall energy demand. "
"That said, it is no silver bullet."

"When the carbon price is increased, notice that Coal (brown line) reduces"
" the most in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph. It is the most"
" carbon intensive source of energy, which makes it the most sensitive to "
"a carbon price. Natural Gas (dark blue line) moves down as well, although"
" more modestly. Oil (red line) decreases only slightly, even though it is"
" more carbon intensive than gas, because it is not easily substituted for"
" other energy sources (e.g. can’t power a diesel truck with wind power). "
"Renewables (green line) increases as the relative cost of wind and solar "
"make them more attractive."

"Just like taxing coal, a significant carbon price increases energy costs,"
" which reduces energy demand. View this in the “Final Energy Consumption”"
" graph, noting that the high carbon price Current Scenario (blue line) is"
