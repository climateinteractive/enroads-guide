"efficiency, technological innovation, and carbon price influence carbon "

"provide a synthesis of the best available science on climate solutions "
"and put it at the fingertips of groups in policy workshops and "

"En-ROADS is a powerful simulation model for exploring how to address "
"global energy and climate challenges through large-scale policy, "
"technological, and societal shifts. With En-ROADS you can create "

" energy efficiency, technological innovation, carbon pricing, fuel mix, "

"En-ROADS is designed to be used interactively with groups where it can be"

"choices of our world. Climate Interactive provides extensive materials to"

"En-ROADS stands for “Energy-Rapid Overview and Decision-Support.\" Led by"

"collaboration between Climate Interactive, Tom Fiddaman of Ventana "
"Systems, Prof. John Sterman of MIT Sloan, and Prof. Juliette Rooney-Varga"
" of UMass Lowell's Climate Change Initiative. En-ROADS is an extension of"
" the award-winning simulator C-ROADS, which thousands have used to assess"
" national and regional greenhouse gas emission reduction pledges and lead"
" climate negotiation exercises. Both tools were developed using the "
"system dynamics modeling approach and draw on the MIT PhD theses of Dr. "

"The model emphasizes the system-wide interactions of policies. Behind the"
" simulation is an extensive study of the latest research literature on "
"factors such as delay times, progress ratios, price sensitivities, "
"historic growth of energy sources, and energy efficiency potential. This "
"enables En-ROADS to reveal the dynamic interactions between different "
"levers. For example, how energy efficiency affects renewable energy, and "
"which feedback loops are most significant."

"C-ROADS focuses on how changes in national and regional emissions could "
"affect global carbon emissions and climate outcomes, while En-ROADS "
"focuses on how global changes in energy, economics, and public policy "
"could affect global carbon emissions and climate outcomes."
