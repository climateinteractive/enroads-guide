"The `En-ROADS Climate Solutions Simulator <https://en-"
"roads.climateinteractive.org>`_ is a fast, powerful climate simulation "
"tool for understanding how we can achieve our climate goals through "
"changes in energy, land use, consumption, agriculture, and other "
"policies. The simulator focuses on how changes in global GDP, energy "
"efficiency, technological innovation, and carbon price influence carbon "
"emissions, global temperature, and other factors. It is designed to "
"provide a synthesis of the best available science on climate solutions "
"and put it at the fingertips of groups in policy workshops and "
"roleplaying games. These experiences enable people to explore the long-"
"term climate impacts of global policy and investment decisions."

"En-ROADS is a powerful simulation model for exploring how to address "
"global energy and climate challenges through large-scale policy, "
"technological, and societal shifts. With En-ROADS you can create "
"scenarios that focus on how changes in taxes, subsidies, economic growth,"
" energy efficiency, technological innovation, carbon pricing, fuel mix, "
"and other factors will change global carbon emissions and temperature."

"En-ROADS is designed to be used interactively with groups where it can be"
" the basis for scientifically rigorous conversations around addressing "
"climate change. This makes it ideal for decision-makers in government, "
"business, and civil society; or for anyone who is curious about the "
"choices of our world. Climate Interactive provides extensive materials to"
" support people in leading activities with En-ROADS that range from "
"policy workshops to roleplaying games."

"Relative to many global energy and climate system models, En-ROADS "
"returns results in a few seconds, is transparent in its mathematical "
"logic, and allows you to interactively test hundreds of factors. En-ROADS"
" complements the other, more disaggregated models addressing similar "
"questions, for example, those in the EMF-22 suite. These larger "
"disaggregated models are used for data and calibrating results in En-"
"ROADS."

"En-ROADS stands for “Energy-Rapid Overview and Decision-Support.\" Led by"
" the team at Climate Interactive, En-ROADS has benefited from a close "
"collaboration between Climate Interactive, Tom Fiddaman of Ventana "
"Systems, Prof. John Sterman of MIT Sloan, and Prof. Juliette Rooney-Varga"
" of UMass Lowell's Climate Change Initiative. En-ROADS is an extension of"
" the award-winning simulator C-ROADS, which thousands have used to assess"
" national and regional greenhouse gas emission reduction pledges and lead"
" climate negotiation exercises. Both tools were developed using the "
"system dynamics modeling approach and draw on the MIT PhD theses of Dr. "
"John Sterman and Dr. Tom Fiddaman."

"The model emphasizes the system-wide interactions of policies. Behind the"
" simulation is an extensive study of the latest research literature on "
"factors such as delay times, progress ratios, price sensitivities, "
"historic growth of energy sources, and energy efficiency potential. This "
"enables En-ROADS to reveal the dynamic interactions between different "
"levers. For example, how energy efficiency affects renewable energy, and "
"which feedback loops are most significant."

"For those familiar with C-ROADS, the distinction between the two is that "
"C-ROADS focuses on how changes in national and regional emissions could "
"affect global carbon emissions and climate outcomes, while En-ROADS "
"focuses on how global changes in energy, economics, and public policy "
"could affect global carbon emissions and climate outcomes."
