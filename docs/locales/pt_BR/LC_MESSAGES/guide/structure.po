"A  simple way to think about the structure of En-ROADS is by considering "
"the drivers of climate impacts. In the simulator, the concentration of "
"greenhouse gases drives up global temperature, which leads to various "
"impacts (e.g., sea level rise and ocean acidification)."

"Going further, CO\\ :sub:`2` emissions from energy are driven by four "
"factors, which is known as the “Kaya Identity”. Population, consumption "
"(GDP/capita),  energy intensity (energy use per dollar of GDP), and "
"carbon intensity (CO\\ :sub:`2` emissions per unit of energy) are all "
"multiplied together and the result is  overall energy CO\\ :sub:`2` "
"emissions. In this way, at a high level, reducing CO\\ :sub:`2` emissions"
" is about four things: fewer people, less consumption, more efficiency, "
"and less high-carbon energy supplies."
