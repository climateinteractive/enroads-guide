"The five methods of CO\\ :sub:`2` removal included are modeled "

"The default settings for the maximum potential of technological carbon "
"removal (“% of max potential”) are sourced from the low range of the 2018"
" ‘Greenhouse gas removal’ report by the Royal Society (Table 2, chapter "
"2). For example, moving the simulator’s biochar slider to “100% of max "
"potential” increases removals up to 2 Gton/yr, which was taken from the "
"report’s range of 2-5 Gton/yr. For higher removal, one can adjust the "
"“Carbon dioxide removal maximum” settings within the “Assumptions” view, "
"up to the highest end of the range sourced from the same report. For "
"example, the biochar maximum can be increased to 5 Gton/yr."

"**Why aren’t coal and gas carbon capture and storage (CCS) included here,"
" and how can I increase them?** We think of coal and gas CCS as reducing "
"CO\\ :sub:`2` emissions from coal and gas, not actually as removing CO\\ "
":sub:`2` from the atmosphere. Both can be changed in the Advanced View "
"that supports the Coal and Natural Gas sliders."
