"**Increase or decrease the energy efficiency of buildings, appliances, "
"and other machines.** Energy efficiency includes things like building "
"well-insulated homes and reducing the amount of energy factories use. "
"Energy efficient practices can save money through reduced energy needs as"
" well as improve the health of people in those buildings."

"energy sources decline in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph - "
