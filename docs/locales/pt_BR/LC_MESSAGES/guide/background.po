"New energy sources (e.g., renewables and new technology) take decades "
"(not years) to scale up to sufficiently compete with coal, oil, and gas. "
"There are two main sources of these delays. New supply capacity doesn’t "
"show up until old, long-lived capacity is retired (e.g., coal-fired power"
" plants and oil refineries, which can survive for ~30 years). Only 6% of "
"the total stock gets added every year. New zero-carbon energy may secure "
"20-50% of that market share, but even then, it adds only 1-3% to the "
"total stock. The climate is only helped when coal, oil, and gas is "
"retired away, and in the absence of other interventions, that amount is "
"relatively small – approximately 3% per year."
