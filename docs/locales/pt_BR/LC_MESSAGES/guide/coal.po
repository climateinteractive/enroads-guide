"**Discourage or encourage mining coal and burning it in power plants.** "
"Coal is the most harmful fossil fuel in terms of carbon emissions, as "
"well as in air pollutants that cause severe health impacts. It is a "
"dominant source of energy globally, however, because it is relatively "
"inexpensive to mine and transport."

"When coal is discouraged, by taxing it, watch the brown line go down in "
