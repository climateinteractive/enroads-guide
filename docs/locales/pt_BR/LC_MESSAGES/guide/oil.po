"**Discourage or encourage drilling, refining, and consuming oil for "
"energy.** Oil is a fossil fuel that is used widely in cars, ships, and "
"planes; it is also used for industry, heating, and electricity. Access to"
" oil has sparked major conflicts, and oil spills threaten ecosystems and "
"water quality."

"When oil is taxed, notice what happens to coal and gas in response. "
"Unless there are restrictions on coal and gas, their demand will go up in"
" response to expensive oil. We call this the “squeeze the balloon” "
"problem – depressing fossil fuel emissions in one area causes them to pop"
" up in another. Renewables are also boosted slightly, but the impact is "
"negligible. Adding a carbon price is a good solution to the “squeeze the "
