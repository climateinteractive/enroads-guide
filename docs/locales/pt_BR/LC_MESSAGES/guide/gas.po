"**Discourage or encourage drilling and burning natural gas for energy.** "
"Natural Gas is a fossil fuel that is used for electricity, heating, and "
"industry. When burned, it releases carbon dioxide (although less than "
"coal and oil) and, if leaked into the air, it contains high amounts of "
"methane. Natural gas drilling uses large amounts of water and can cause "
"contamination."

"If gas is taxed, in absence of other policies, the opposite of the above "
"is true; natural gas goes down, but high-carbon coal and oil increase, "
"with no net benefit on emissions or temperature change. We call this the "
"“squeeze the balloon” problem – depressing fossil fuel emissions in one "
"area causes them to pop up in another. Adding a carbon price is a good "
"solution to the “squeeze the balloon” problem, as it addresses all fossil"
" fuels together."
