|imgTechRemovalIcon| Technological Carbon Dioxide Removal
==========================================================

**Pull carbon dioxide out of the air with new technologies that enhance natural removals or manually sequester and store carbon.** Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) technologies include: direct air capture, bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), biochar, and others. These are not yet used at large scales, and most face significant barriers to deployment.

Examples
--------

* Advancements in various CDR technologies through research and development and government policies.

* Support from businesses, land owners, and general public to implement such technologies.

Key Dynamics
------------

* View the graph “Land for Carbon Dioxide Removal” and note the total amount of land area that all the approaches might require.

Big Message
-----------

* While Technological Carbon Removal has potential, it does not currently exist at scale.

Model Structure
---------------

The five methods of CO\ :sub:`2` removal included are modeled independently. They each vary in their maximum sequestration potential, the year they might start to scale up, how long it takes them to be phased in, and the carbon leakage rate over time (stored carbon is not always permanent).

Potential Co-Benefits of CDR Growth
-------------------------------------
•	Nature-based carbon removal approaches like agricultural soil sequestration can help improve land holder and farmer profits in some cases.
•	The scale up of many carbon removal approaches would result in vast new industries and businesses which would create jobs. 

Equity Considerations 
-----------------------
•	Approaches like BECCS require large areas of land that in some cases could be used for food production.
•	Many of the technological carbon removal approaches have not been developed at scale yet and pose unknown risks and consequences to the communities they are situated within.
