|imgAfforestationIcon| AFFORESTATION
====================================

**Plant new forests and restore old forests.** As trees grow, they draw carbon out of the air, which reduces the concentration of carbon dioxide. However, without care, large-scale afforestation can compromise biodiversity and historical land rights.

Examples
--------

* Government policies, incentives, and funding to identify available land, plant trees, and manage forests.

* Business, land owner, and public support for large scale tree planting.

Key Dynamics
------------

* Growing more trees boosts global removal of CO\ :sub:`2` from the atmosphere. Photosynthesis pulls carbon into biomass and soils. Watch the temperature decrease modestly as a result.

* Explore the graph â€œLand for Carbon Dioxide Removal". The land mass of India is 300 million hectares, so if we were to forest an area of that size we would still not see much change in temperature.

Big Message
-----------

* This could be part of the silver buckshot, but land availability and other effects should be considered.

Model Structure
---------------

The input changes total or gross carbon removal from trees and plants through photosynthesis. The carbon sequestration of forests changes over time as the forest matures. Notice that net carbon removals are different than total removals due to carbon loss in older or unhealthy forests.
