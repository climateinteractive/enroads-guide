What is the purpose of En-ROADS?
---------------------------------

The purpose of En-ROADS is to improve decision-maker understanding of the dynamics of the climate-energy-land-economic system, particularly focusing on policy-makers, citizens, educators, and business leaders.

En-ROADS is designed to provide a synthesis of the best available science on climate solutions and put it at the fingertips of groups in policy workshops and role-playing games. These experiences enable people to explore the long-term climate impacts of global policy and investment decisions.


What sort of model is En-ROADS?
---------------------------------
The En-ROADS (Energy - Rapid Overview And Decision Support) simulator is a system dynamics model. It was built in Vensim modeling language and transformed into an online simulation via the SD Everywhere converter built by Climate Interactive and Todd Fincannon. 

En-ROADS is an extension of (and contains most all of) the C-ROADS simulator, which focuses on international and regional dynamics.


How did you build confidence in En-ROADS? 
-------------------------------------------

In order to build confidence, we conducted a full suite of tests: 

1) Extreme Conditions 

2) Assumption Sensitivity 

3) Behavior Reproduction (historical behavior and future projections, particularly from six Integrated Assessment Models’ baseline scenario for SSP2, but also including scenarios from IEA and Shell)

4) Relevance to Users 

For more information, please view a recording of our `Confidence Building Webinar <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfPSSsc7sNo&t=1s>`_, which explores the tests listed above. 

What are your biggest critiques of the model, and possible future areas of improvement?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Some critiques and areas of improvement include: 

#. Global aggregation limits treatment of heterogeneity between regions and countries.
#. The level of detail limits tactical planning of energy system. It is not a “bottom-up” model.
#. The global economy in the model is not fully endogenous:
    
    - Growth of GDP per capita can be adjusted by the user; assumes regional convergence of GDP per capita at 1%/year over time
    - Although the magnitude of subsidies and taxes is assessed, the uses of funds for subsidies and taxes are not accounted for (e.g., revenue recycling from a carbon price)
    - Some technology policies (for example, improvement in energy efficiency) are costless
    - Implicit, transient non-conservation of money and unserved demand are possible

#.	Equity, non-climate environment, health and other effects are not included.
#.	Some inputs (e.g., energy supplies) specify taxes or subsidies to drive change in the system while others (e.g., energy efficiency, methane emissions, deforestation) directly drive change, avoiding the taxes or subsidies that might drive the change.
#.	While En-ROADS includes multiple feedback processes (e.g., carbon fertilization and carbon saturation), it does not explicitly include the effects of various biogeochemical feedback processes such as the positive feedback due to the albedo effect or the release of methane from permafrost.


Who created the En-ROADS System Dynamics model?
--------------------------------------------------

En-ROADS is based on research originally conducted in the mid-1990s at MIT, and has been developed by a partnership of MIT’s Sloan School of Management, Ventana Systems, and Climate Interactive. The lead modeler at Climate Interactive is Dr. Lori Siegel and at Ventana Systems, Dr. Thomas Fiddaman, whose 1997 MIT doctoral dissertation forms the foundation of the carbon cycle and climate sector. Professor John Sterman of MIT Sloan oversees the modeling science.

Who holds the copyright to the simulation?
--------------------------------------------

En-ROADS is copyrighted by Climate Interactive and Ventana Systems.

Where does the financial support behind En-ROADS come from?
--------------------------------------------------------------

The development and use of En-ROADS has been supported by ClimateWorks, the Hewlett Foundation, the Goldman-Sonnenfeldt Foundation, Active Philanthropy, Zennström Philanthropies, the KR Foundation, HSBC, the Morgan Family Foundation, The Why Wait Fund, The Rockefeller Brothers Fund and others.

In-kind contributions have been made by multiple project partners.

Where did you get your data? What data does En-ROADS use?
------------------------------------------------------------

En-ROADS was built using the best available science and data, with sources such as the IEA, the EIA, and the IPCC. The En-ROADS simulator is driven by its own equations, not external datasets, and is calibrated against history and projections. Default values and bounds on economic, energy, and climate related dynamics have been determined from an extensive review of literature; all parameters and equations are available in the `En-ROADS Reference Guide <https://www.climateinteractive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/En-ROADS_Reference_Guide_v91.docx>`_. For those interested, many parameters or assumptions that we make can be changed in the “Assumptions” view under the “Simulation” menu. 

What does the Business as Usual or Reference scenario most closely match in the climate literature?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When comparing Radiative Forcing of the En-ROADS Business as Usual scenario against the RCP scenarios from other more disaggregated models, the En-ROADS Business as Usual scenario is lower than RCP 8.5 and higher than RCP 6.0. 

Amongst the `Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) <https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/part1_iiasa_rogelj_ssp_poster.pdf>`_, the Business as Usual scenario mostly closely matches SSP2 — Middle of the road (medium challenges to mitigation and adaptation.

What are other simulations similar to En-ROADS?
-----------------------------------------------------

For a more technical approach, we suggest reviewing the 18 models in `The Energy Modeling Forum suite <https://emf.stanford.edu/>`_, organized by Stanford University. 

The Integrated Assessment Models against which we compare En-ROADS for SSPs include AIM/CGE, WITCH-GLOBIOM, IMAGE, GCAM4, MESSAGE-GLOBIOM, and REMIND-MAGPIE.

Where can I learn about the science, assumptions, testing, and background of the En-ROADS simulation?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

All assumptions and equations are documented in the `En-ROADS Reference Guide <https://www.climateinteractive.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/En-ROADS_Reference_Guide_v91.docx>`_.

Assumptions most relevant to model users are available within other sections of this `online and searchable user guide <https://docs.climateinteractive.org/projects/en-roads/en/latest/index.html>`_.

Other supporting materials on modeling science are available on `our website <https://www.climateinteractive.org>`_.
