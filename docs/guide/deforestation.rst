|imgDeforestationIcon| Deforestation
====================================

**Decrease or increase the loss of forests for agricultural and wood product uses.** Deforestation often entails burning and removing forests to clear land for crops like soybeans, corn, or palm oil. Forest protection efforts increase biodiversity and can support community resilience.

Examples
--------

* Government policy to preserve forested land and place restrictions on industries such as soybean and/or palm oil.

* Increased support for indigenous land rights.

* Public support and campaigns to support land preservation.

Key Dynamics
------------

* Highly reducing deforestation emissions reduces temperature less than most people would estimate. View the “Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas – Area” graph to see the role of land use (deforestation) CO\ :sub:`2` relative to all the other sources of emissions.

Big Message
-----------

* Efforts to reduce deforestation are relatively low leverage for the climate, but are one part of a multi-pronged effort.

* Protecting forests is helpful for many reasons other than the environment, including protecting biodiversity and native people’s lands.

Model Structure
-----------------

Emissions from deforestation stay level in the business as usual scenario.
