|imgDeforestationIcon| Deforestation
====================================

**Decrease or increase the loss of forests for agricultural and wood product uses.** Deforestation often entails burning and removing forests to clear land for crops like soybeans, corn, or palm oil. Forest protection efforts increase biodiversity and can support community resilience.

Examples
--------

* Government policy to preserve forested land and place restrictions on industries such as soybean and/or palm oil.

* Increased support for indigenous land rights.

* Public support and campaigns to support land preservation.

Big Messages
------------

* Efforts to reduce deforestation are relatively low leverage for the climate, but are one part of a multi-pronged effort.

* Protecting forests is helpful for many reasons other than climate action, including biodiversity conservation and protection of native peoples' lands.

Key Dynamics
------------

* Highly reducing deforestation emissions reduces temperature less than most people would estimate. View the “Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas – Area” graph to see the role of land use (deforestation) CO\ :sub:`2` relative to all the other sources of emissions.

Potential Co-Benefits of Decreasing Deforestation
----------------------------------------------------
•	Forests protect biodiversity and provide ecosystem services and food sources.
•	Forest preservation reduces erosion and prevents soil loss.
•	Forests provide livelihoods for people (e.g., small-scale resource gathering and sustainable forestry) that can be lost when land is shifted to other uses. 

Equity Considerations 
---------------------
•	Forest preservation efforts have sometimes restricted the land access of indigenous people who have lived sustainably on the land for generations. Policies should be created with local stakeholder engagement. [#deforestationfn1]_ [#deforestationfn2]_
