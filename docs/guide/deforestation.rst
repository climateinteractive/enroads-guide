|image47| DEFORESTATION
=======================

**Decrease or increase the loss of forests for agricultural and wood product uses.** Deforestation often entails burning and removing forests to clear land for crops like soybeans, corn, or palm oil. Forest protection efforts increase biodiversity and can support community resilience.

.. _examples-14:

Examples
--------

-  Government policy to preserve forested land and place restrictions on industries such as soybean and/or palm oil.

-  Increased support for indigenous land rights.

-  Public support and campaigns to support land preservation.

Key Dynamics
------------

-  Highly reducing deforestation emissions reduces temperature less than most people would estimate. View the “Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas – Area” graph to see the role of land use (deforestation) CO\ :sub:`2` relative to all the other sources of emissions.

.. _big-message-12:

Big Message
-----------

-  Efforts to reduce deforestation are relatively low leverage for the climate, but are one part of a multi-pronged effort.

-  Protecting forests is helpful for many reasons other than the environment, including protecting biodiversity and native people’s lands.

| Model Structure
| Emissions from deforestation stay level in the business as usual scenario.
