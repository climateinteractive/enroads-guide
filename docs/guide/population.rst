|imgPopIcon| Population Growth 
===============================

**Assume higher or lower population growth.** Population is a key driver of increased greenhouse gases; however, this is also tied heavily to consumption habits. Women’s education and access to family planning could accelerate shifts to smaller families worldwide.

Examples
--------

* Different assumptions for future fertility rates and demographics.

* Greater empowerment of women and girls, resulting in lower fertility rates.

* Increased education on and access to reproductive health services.

Big Message
-----------

* Contrary to some people’s beliefs, population growth is not a silver bullet for addressing climate change.

* Decisions around population and family choice are very personal decisions and efforts to shift these decisions have ethical implications in many cultures.

Key Dynamics
------------

* Watch all the sources of energy change as you change population growth.

Potential Co-Benefits of Lower Growth
--------------------------------------
•	Lower population growth reduces global consumption of resources. 
•	Ensuring safe access to family planning, reproductive health services, and women’s education enhances quality of life and income for women.

Equity Considerations 
----------------------
•	Policies around population should be voluntary and empower women to make the choices that are best for them. 
•	A higher percentage of women of color live in countries with severe gender inequities in access to education, full economic and political participation, and adequate family planning. Reducing population growth necessitates a large investment in that particular group. 
•	There is a history of women of color in both high- and low-income countries being forcibly sterilized to prevent giving birth; this should never be encouraged. [#popgrowthfn1]_ [#popgrowthfn2]_ [#popgrowthfn3]_ [#popgrowthfn4]_

Slider Settings
---------------

The slider reflects the 95% probability range of population deviating from the United Nation's medium population growth path. This input is indexed across the UN's scenarios, where -1 is the low end of the UN’s growth range, 0 is the medium growth scenario, and 1 is the high end of the range.

================== ========================= =================== ================================ ==================== ===============================
\                  lowest growth             low growth          **status quo**                   high growth          highest growth
================== ========================= =================== ================================ ==================== ===============================
Population in 2100 9.1 to 9.5 billion        9.5 to 10.5 billion  **10.5 to 11.4 billion**        11.4 to 12.8 billion 12.8 to 13.2 billion
================== ========================= =================== ================================ ==================== ===============================

Model Structure
---------------

Population gets multiplied with economic growth (GDP per capita) to equal total global GDP, or Gross World Product.
