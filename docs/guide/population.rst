|imgPopIcon| Population Growth 
===============================

**Assume higher or lower population growth.** Population is a key driver of increased greenhouse gases; however, this is also tied heavily to consumption habits. Women’s education and access to family planning could accelerate shifts to smaller families worldwide.

Examples
--------

* Different assumptions for future fertility rates and demographics.

* Greater empowerment of women and girls, resulting in lower fertility rates.

* Increased education on and access to reproductive health services.

Big Message
-----------

* Contrary to some people’s beliefs, population growth is not a silver bullet for addressing climate change.

* Decisions around population and family choice are very personal decisions and efforts to shift these decisions have ethical implications in many cultures.

Key Dynamics
------------

* Watch all the sources of energy change as you change population growth.

Potential Co-Benefits of Lower Growth
--------------------------------------
•	Lower population growth reduces global consumption of resources. 
•	Ensuring safe access to family planning, reproductive health services, and women’s education enhances quality of life and income for women.

Equity Considerations 
----------------------
•	Policies around population should be voluntary and empower women to make the choices that are best for them. 
•	A higher percentage of women of color live in countries with severe gender inequities in access to education, full economic and political participation, and adequate family planning. Reducing population growth necessitates a large investment in that particular group. 
•	There is a history of women of color in both high- and low-income countries being forcibly sterilized to prevent giving birth, this should not be encouraged. [#popgrowthfn1]_ [#popgrowthfn2]_ [#popgrowthfn3]_ [#popgrowthfn4]_

Slider Settings
---------------

We used the UN’s population scenarios to drive population in En-ROADS. This input is indexed, where 1 is the UN’s low growth scenario, 2 is medium, and 3 is high. The slider is limited to a range of 1.3-2.5 to reflect the 95% probability range of population deviating from the medium growth path.

================== =========== ================ ============
\                  low growth  **status quo**   high growth
================== =========== ================ ============
UN Scenario        1.3 to 2    **2 to 2.3**     2.3 to 2.5
Population by 2100 8.4 billion **11.1 billion** 13.2 billion
================== =========== ================ ============

Model Structure
---------------

Population gets multiplied with economic growth (GDP per capita) to equal total global GDP, or Gross World Product.
