|image43| BUILDINGS AND INDUSTRY – ENERGY EFFICIENCY 
=====================================================

**Increase or decrease the energy efficiency of buildings, appliances, and other machines.** Energy efficiency includes things like building well-insulated homes and reducing the amount of energy factories use. Energy efficient practices can save money through reduced energy needs as well as improve the health of people in those buildings.

.. _examples-10:

Examples
--------

-  Individuals and businesses changing their behavior to insulate buildings, purchase energy efficient technologies (motors, lighting, appliances, servers, HVAC systems), and conserve energy.

-  Government policies such as tax breaks and performance standards to incentivize energy efficient products and practices.

-  Research and development into high efficiency technologies.

The variable being changed is the annual improvement rate in the energy intensity of new capital.

Key Dynamics
------------

-  As less energy is used for buildings and industry notice how all the energy sources come down in the “Sources of Primary Energy” graph. Less coal, oil, and gas are burned so CO\ :sub:`2` emissions go down and global temperature change is lowered dramatically.

-  Improvements in energy intensity of new capital also reduce energy demand. Explore this in the “Final Energy Consumption” graph, where the current scenario (blue line) is lower than business as usual (black line).

.. _big-message-8:

Big Message
-----------

-  Energy efficiency of buildings and factories is high leverage. It leads to less coal, oil, and gas being used. It also saves families, business, and communities money.

Model Structure
---------------

Increasing the rate of improvement in energy use for new technology and infrastructure lowers emissions gradually, because energy use is driven by the overall average of all infrastructure in this area, which is delayed from this intervention due to its relatively long lifetime.
