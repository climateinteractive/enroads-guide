En-ROADS Model Version History
===============================

March 2020 Release
------------------
Model upgrade
-------------

Updated 
~~~~~~~
- En-ROADS model to version 2.7.11
- Updated the equation for the energy intensity of new capital to better respond to price effects.
- BAU improvement rate in emission intensity and Annual improvement rate of emission intensity for F-gases were adjusted to reflect SSP2 baseline trajectories.
- The settings for CH\ :sub:`4` and N\ :sub:`2`\O emissions from Ag and waste have also been slightly updated.

Graphs
------
Fixed 
~~~~~
- Add “Hydro” data to “Average Cost of Electricity Production” graph and correct the name of “Renew/Hydro” to Renewables”
- Corrected several missing Related graphs in some advanced views. 
- Corrected the variable in “Marginal Cost of Renewables” graph

Updated 
~~~~~~~
- Edited the description for “CH\ :sub:`4` Emissions” graph and corrected the plotted variable to display anthropogenic CH\ :sub:`4` emissions.
- Edited “Storage Costs” graph description for clarity.
- Edited the description for “Cumulative CO\ :sub:`2` Emissions” graph.
- Change graph name from “Fuel Production Cost" to "Fuel Production Cost by Source" to make it consistent with the titles of the other graphs in the Financial category that are broken out by energy source.
- Added “Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas—Area” to related graphs for Deforestation 

Control Slider related changes
------------------------------
Fixed 
~~~~~
- Updated New Tech slider description to match what the slider settings do. 
- Added back a missing description for slider, “Coal CCS R&D breakthrough cost reduction”
- Edit description for slider, “% Reduction in Coal Utilization”

Updated 
~~~~~~~
- Edit slider names referring to final carbon price, removing the word “target” so it is now: 
    - Final carbon price (previously, Final Carbon price final target)
    - Year to start achieving final carbon price (previously, Year to start achieving final carbon price target)
    - Years to achieve final carbon price (previously, Years to achieve final carbon price target)
- Added back assumptions sliders for "Methane emissions from biological activity", "Effect of temperature on methane emissions from permafrost and clathrates", and "Temperature threshold for permafrost and clathrates"

Other interface changes
-----------------------
New
~~~
- You can create a large copy of any of the graphs to use on additional screens or monitors. The graph outputs in the copies remain connected to changes in the control input sliders. These graphs are accessed under the View menu, as “Large Left Graph and “Large Right graph”. You may select multiple copies of left or right graphs. 

Coming soon
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Localization to many languages is in process.
