En-ROADS Model Version History
===============================

.. Comment: Suggest using three levels of Headings for this document to make the 
   Table of Contents cleaner.
   H1 = ------   This is only for the new version name, like "March 2020 Release"
   H2 = ~~~~~~   For main areas
   H3 = ^^^^^^   For sub areas

August 2020 Release
-------------------

Interface Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

New
^^^
- **Portuguese**: En-ROADS is now available in Portuguese!  Localization to more languages is in progress, and we hope to come to your native language soon.
- Initial **iPad Support**: You can now run En-ROADS on your iPad (in Safari or your preferred browser)!  In this release, the user experience is better on iPad models released in the last 3 years.  In upcoming releases, we will be working to improve performance and refine the user experience across all iPad models.

Updated
^^^^^^^
- Improved performance in a number of areas, so sliders should feel smoother and more responsive (and further improvements are in the works).
- When sharing a scenario, the user's preference for Metric vs U.S. Units is captured and remembered in the URL.

Control Slider Related Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^
- Updated the "Carbon Price" slider description to include bioenergy in the list of impacts.
- Removed accidental mention of deforestation in the "Other greenhouse gases start year" slider description under "Methane & Other Gases".


July 2020 Release
-----------------

Graphs
~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^
- Corrected the y-axis of the "Marginal Cost of Electricity Production" graph to adjust dynamically to keep graph lines in view.
- Corrected the "Renewables Primary Energy Demand" graph to reflect hydro in addition to renewables.

Control Slider Related Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fixed
^^^^^
- Improved descriptions for the "Year to stop building new infrastructure" sliders for coal, oil, and natural gas.

Other Interface Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated
^^^^^^^
- Improved email sharing of scenarios by showing a preview of the message to be sent, and allowing for a custom note to be included with the shared scenario.
- Changed the welcome screen to direct feedback and questions to `support.climateinteractive.org <https://support.climateinteractive.org/>`_.
- Changed the "General FAQs" link under the Help menu to direct to the Knowledge Base on the support site.


May 2020 Release
------------------

Model Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated 
^^^^^^^
- En-ROADS model to version 2.7.19
- Add email sharing of your current scenario to "Share Scenario" menu button. 
- Update GDP with 2018 World Bank data. 

Fixed 
^^^^^
- Minor edits to description texts

April 2020 Release
------------------

Model Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated 
^^^^^^^
- En-ROADS model to version 2.7.14
- Added link to "Uses for En-ROADS" under the Help menu
- Add menu control for "Reset Policies" sliders and "Reset Assumptions" sliders under "Simulation" menu; changed wording of  "Reset" to "Reset Policies & Assumptions."

Graphs
~~~~~~
- When switching from Metric Units to U.S. Units, the "Land for Carbon Dioxide Removal" graph switches from "Million hectares" to "Million acres".

Fixed 
^^^^^
- Improved location of icons in the top toolbar to help avoid accidental clicks on the “Reset Policies & Assumptions” icon (formerly, “Reset sliders” tool tip).
- Correcting Large graph feature so graphs are sized correctly in the remote window.
- Edits to description texts for "Coal carbon capture & storage (CCS) (tax/subsidy)" slider, "Gas carbon capture & storage (CCS) (tax/subsidy)" slider and the overall description for Nuclear in the advanced views.


March 2020 Release
------------------

Along with the details listed below, we've made a cool video highlighting the important feature additions and changes to model behavior.

Model Upgrade
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Updated 
^^^^^^^
- En-ROADS model to version 2.7.11
- Updated the equation for the Energy Intensity of New Capital to better respond to price effects
- BAU improvement rate in emission intensity and Annual improvement rate of emission intensity for F-gases were adjusted to reflect SSP2 baseline trajectories
- The settings for CH\ :sub:`4` and N\ :sub:`2`\O emissions from agriculture and waste have also been slightly updated

Graphs
~~~~~~

Fixed 
^^^^^
- Add “Hydro” data to “Average Cost of Electricity Production” graph and correct the name of “Renew/Hydro” to Renewables”
- Corrected several missing Related Graphs in some advanced views
- Corrected the variable in “Marginal Cost of Renewables” graph
- Corrected typo in descriptions for N\ :sub:`2`\O and CH\ :sub:`4` graphs (Megatons was corrected to 1x10\ :sup:`6`)
- The y-axis label in graph "CO\ :sub:`2` Emissions" was corrected to Gigatons CO\ :sub:`2`\/year

Updated 
^^^^^^^
- Edited the description for “CH\ :sub:`4` Emissions” graph and corrected the plotted variable to display anthropogenic CH\ :sub:`4` emissions
- Edited “Storage Costs” graph description for clarity
- Edited the description for “Cumulative CO\ :sub:`2` Emissions” graph
- Changed the graph name from “Fuel Production Cost" to "Fuel Production Cost by Source" to make it consistent with the titles of the other graphs in the Financial category that are broken out by energy source
- Added “Greenhouse Gas Net Emissions by Gas—Area” to related graphs for Deforestation 

Control Slider Related Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Fixed 
^^^^^
- Updated New Tech slider description to match what the slider settings do
- Added back a missing description for slider, “Coal CCS R&D breakthrough cost reduction”
- Edit description for slider, “% Reduction in Coal Utilization”

Updated 
^^^^^^^
- Edit slider names referring to final carbon price, removing the word “target” so it is now: 
    - Final carbon price (previously, Final Carbon price final target)
    - Year to start achieving final carbon price (previously, Year to start achieving final carbon price target)
    - Years to achieve final carbon price (previously, Years to achieve final carbon price target)
- Added back assumptions sliders for "Methane emissions from biological activity", "Effect of temperature on methane emissions from permafrost and clathrates", and "Temperature threshold for permafrost and clathrates"

Other Interface Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
New
^^^
- You can create a large copy of any of the graphs to use on additional screens or monitors. The graph outputs in the copies remain connected to changes in the control input sliders. These graphs are accessed under the View menu, as “Large Left Graph and “Large Right graph”. You may select multiple copies of left or right graphs. 

Coming Soon
~~~~~~~~~~~
- Localization to many languages is in process! We hope to come to your native language soon!
