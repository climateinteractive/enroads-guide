|imgTranElecIcon| Transport – Electrification
==============================================

**Increase or decrease purchases of new electric cars, trucks, buses, trains, and ships.** Using electric motors for transport helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution if the electricity is from low carbon sources like solar and wind.

Examples
--------

-  Investments into electric vehicle charging infrastructure.

-  Research and development into the technologies for vehicles, batteries, and charging.

-  Corporate commitments to sales of electric vehicles.

-  Programs to offer rebates and incentives to electric car purchases.

Slider Settings
---------------

The variable being changed is the annual growth rate of electricity used in new transport capital such as vehicles, trains, and ships.

=========== =========== ============== ============ ===================
\           discouraged **status quo** incentivized highly incentivized
=========== =========== ============== ============ ===================
Annual rate -3% to -1%  **-1% to +1%** +1% to +3%   +3% to +5%
=========== =========== ============== ============ ===================

Key Dynamics
------------

* As you increase Transport Electrification, there are two main forces that affect future temperature:

  * Overall “well-to-wheel” efficiency is greater for electrified transport than for internal combustion engines – in general, less fuel is used to power transport with electricity than oil. This reduces emissions and temperature.

  * Oil, in the “Global Sources of Primary Energy” graph, goes down as we electrify transport. At the same time, increased electrical demand is powered by coal and, to a more limited extent, renewables (in the absence of a carbon price or other taxes).

Big Message
-----------

* If the world is dependent on coal and natural gas for electric power, the net effect of electrification is essentially no change in emissions and temperature.
* Switching to electric modes of transport makes the biggest impact for the climate when electrical energy sources are low carbon.

Model Structure
---------------

Unlike the inputs for energy sources, which change the financial attractiveness to drive future behavior, this input directly forces growth of electrification up toward a maximum percentage.

Potential Co-Benefits of Encouraging Electrification
-------------------------------------------------------
- Improved air quality at the source increases healthcare savings and worker productivity.
- Jobs are created in the manufacturing and sales of electric batteries and engines.

Equity Considerations
---------------------
•	Although costs are coming down, electric vehicles may not be affordable or available to everyone.
•	Mining of lithium and copper, two necessary ingredients for the batteries used in electric vehicles, can wreak havoc on precious ecosystems and threaten the well-being of communities at the mining sites.  
•	Electric charging station locations may not be accessible or the electric battery range may be insufficient for some situations.
